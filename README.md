This is an event booking web app called 'Event Bulb'.  
Using Python and the Djang framework I created this web app with users and events and alows users to sign up to events.  This project used GitHub for version control and was deployed with Heroku.

This was a project I created at CodeClan Digital Skills Academy on the web Development Essentials Course. 
This was an 8 week course that covered all the fundamentals of object orientated programming and took us on a journey to create and full stack web application. learning version control with Git and GitHub and deployment with Heroku.

During this project I learned:

How to work with Ajile methodologies

Fundamnetals on HTML, CSS, PYTHON, DJANGO framework, PostgreSQL, Object Orientated Programming. 

Error handling

Version control with GIT and GITHUB

Deployment with HEROKU

Cloud sharing services with AWS

Learnings for next project:

Testing regularly and writing good tests is essential

Regularly Git commits aid version control 

Paired programming and asking for help after short periods of jamming is good practice.
